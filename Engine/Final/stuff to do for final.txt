two agent types

Miner
- wander and search for resources to mine(wander behaviour)
- if sees resources go to resources(arrive behaviour), 
	mine the resources for a couple seconds and get stuff (no behaviour)
- bring stuff back to main base (arrive behaviour) ->set location of base on load
- if chased by bad guy, run away (flee behaviour)


Bad Guy
- wander and search for miners (wander behaviour)
- if sees miner, chase miner until it gets it (pursuit behaviour)
- steal resources from miner
- bring resources back to bad guy base (arrive behaviour)


BOTH MINERS AND BAD GUYS HAVE TO AVOID OBSTACLES

Resource
- when mined, can't be mined for a period of time


change miner and bad guy sprite



ask if there's a better way to get position and target type
